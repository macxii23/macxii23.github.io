## About Me

I am a Master's student in Traffic and Transportation Engineering at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, working under the supervision of [Prof. Chengcheng Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PS_CX0AAAAAJ). My research focuses on **Generative and Embodied Artificial Intelligence for intelligent transportation systems**, with particular interests in:

- Generative AI-based intelligent civil infrastructure management
- Learning-based quadruped robotic control for highway maintenance
- Graph-based transportation modeling

I am expected to graduate in June 2026. During my studies, I have maintained a GPA of 3.92/4.0, ranking 2/72 in my major and 4/276 overall in the School.

## Research Highlights

My research has been published in top-tier venues including **ICRA 2026**, **Transportation Research Part E** (IF 8.8, JCR Q1), **Automation in Construction** (IF 11.5, JCR Q1), and **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems** (IF 8.4, JCR Q1). I have also presented my work at the **Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meetings**, one of the top transportation conferences.

**Key Achievements:**
- 🏆 **ICRA 2026** accepted paper on autonomous highway inspection with quadruped robots
- 🏆 **Best Paper Award** at the 16th National Youth Conference on Transportation
- 🏆 **China National Scholarship** (twice, top 3%)
- 🏆 **Outstanding Graduate Student Cadre** (only 2 recipients)

## Current Research Projects

### 1. Autonomous Inspection of Complex Highway Environments Using Quadruped Robot
*Group Leader | Sep 2024 - Present*

I proposed a quadrupedal multi-level locomotion framework based on reinforcement learning for autonomous highway inspection, combining locomotion control and coverage path planning. The system achieved 100% coverage of 14,400 m² highway environment in 0.4 hours and is currently being deployed in real-world scenarios.

### 2. Generalized Graph Partitioning for Accelerated Large-Scale Traffic Parallel Simulation
*Group Leader | Feb 2024 - Aug 2024*

Developed a traffic parallel simulation framework based on hierarchical graph neural networks, achieving 13.23 times acceleration on a provincial highway network with more than 98% accuracy. The framework has been applied in the Henan highway simulation platform.

### 3. Graph-Based Generative Model for Automatic Intelligent Highway Interchange Design
*Group Leader | Sep 2023 - Aug 2024*

Developed an objective-directed graph generative approach that automates highway interchange design, cutting design time from days to sub-second while improving throughput by 5.67% and reducing cost by 27.63%.
