I am currently a final-year Master's student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, working under the supervision of [Prof. Chengcheng Xu]([‪Chengcheng Xu‬ - ‪Google Scholar‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzmJ1nkAAAAJ&hl=en)). I earned my Bachelor degree in Traffic Engineering (Mao Yisheng Class) from Southeast University in 2023.

My research concentrates on **Generative and Embodied Artificial Intelligence for Intelligent Transportation Systems**. Standing at the inflection point where AI is reshaping transportation research, I aim to explore how emerging technologies can transcend the boundaries of traditional modeling, optimization, and decision-making paradigms. My ultimate goal is to construct more intelligent and trustworthy autonomous transportation systems.

Specifically, my work focuses on the following key areas:

- **Generative AI-based intelligent civil infrastructure design and optimization**
  - [Objective-Directed Deep Graph Generative Model for Automatic and Intelligent Highway Interchange Design](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2025.105982) (AIC 2025)
  - Image-based Interchange Structure Design and Optimization using Conditional Diffusion Models, working in progress

- **Embodied AI-driven quadruped robot learning in highway environments**
  - Full-Scale Autonomous Highway Inspection with Quadruped Robot: Multi-Level Locomotion Learning in Complex Environments (ICRA 2026)
  - Reinforcement Learning-based Coverage Path Planning for Large-scale Unknown 3D Highway Environments, working in progress

- **Graph-based transportation systems modeling**
  - [Graph Neural Network-Based Generalized Graph Partitioning for Accelerated Large-Scale Microscopic Traffic Parallel Simulation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2025.104586) (TRE 2026)
  - [A Geometric Deep Learning Approach to Traffic Flow Shockwave Prediction on Freeways Using Vehicle Trajectory Data and HD Map](http://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2025.3563767) (IEEE T-ITS 2025)
